## My process

### Built with

- [Responsive] - Started by building the layout for the three resolutions
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Hook Form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) - Fine grain form management
- [tailwindcss/forms](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/forms) - Provides a basic reset for form styles

### What I learned

- How to use a new library: Tailwind/forms.
- Went deep in the functionality of the HookForms.
- Learned solve a challenge without the usually provided assets.

### Continued development

- Build for three resolutions poses new difficulties in the Tailwind infrastructure of CSS.
- Next challenge could be a 'fluid design' that works in all resolutions...

### Useful resources

- Documentation of the React Hook Form was very helpful.
